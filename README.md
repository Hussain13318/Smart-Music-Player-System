# Smart-Music-Player-System
I recently developed a Music Player System that combines data structures and a graphical user interface (GUI) to deliver a smooth and intelligent music experience.

## Key Highlights:
Play & Manage Songs: Play songs in order, navigate next/previous, and create/manage playlists easily.
Fast Search: Implemented a Trie for instant search of songs by typing the first few letters.
Smart Recommendations: Built a Graph-based recommendation system using song features, genre, and artist similarity.
User-Friendly GUI: Designed using SFML and TGUI with a custom template library for consistent and easy-to-use buttons and panels.
Data Handling: Stores songs and playlists in CSV files for easy loading and saving.
Efficient Navigation: Uses a Circular Doubly Linked List for seamless playlist navigation.

## Technologies & Data Structures Used:
C++ for backend logic
SFML & TGUI for GUI
Trie, Graphs, Circular Doubly Linked Lists for fast search, recommendations, and playlist management

## Note:
Two zip files are attached; you may choose either one at your convenience.
